    question: "Can Evid be self-hosted?",

    id: "bi-replace",

      "No. Evid works beside Metabase, Looker Studio, Looker, Power BI, or other BI tools, governing the AI layer around published context. It doesn't need to replace your charts.",

  {
    id: "vs-generic",
    question: "How is this different from a generic AI SQL tool?",
    answer:
      "Questions are scoped to a published dashboard, grounded in business rules and caveats, limited to approved tables, and gated by role-based publishing. Every answer comes back with the SQL, the source tables, and the context that shaped it, so you can check the work.",
  },
  {
    id: "byo-model",
    question: "Can we bring our own model credentials?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Admins configure provider and API keys in settings (encrypted at rest). Environment-variable fallback remains supported for first-run and self-host setups.",

  {
    id: "per-dashboard-bq",
